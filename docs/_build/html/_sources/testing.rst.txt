Testing
=======

There are test scripts / models available for code validation and future
development.  Please use existing tests if fixing bug / editing existing
features, or create new tests for new features. Ipython notebooks documenting
testing, performance, etc. are also saved in some of the testing directories.

-------------
Generate a simple 3D hexahedral mesh without any symmetry boundary
conditions, and apply a 0.5% top load strain.

vf105
-----
Generate a quarter-symmetry, 3D hexahedral mesh and simulate a typical
VF10-5 ARF excitation.
